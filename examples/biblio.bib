  abstract =      {We propose a model of direction-sensitive units in
                   human vision. It is a modified and elaborated version
                   of a model by Reichardt [Z. Naturforsch . Teil B 12,
                   447 (1957)]. The model is applied to threshold
                   experiments in which subjects view adjacent vertical
                   bars with independently (typically sinusoidally),
                   temporally modulated luminances. The subject must
                   report whether the patterns moved to the left or to
                   the right. According to the model, a basic
                   motion-detecting unit consists of two subunits tuned
                   to opposite directions. Each performs a spatial and
                   temporal linear filtering of its input; outputs of
                   the filters are multiplied, and the multiplied output
                   is integrated (for a time that is long relative to
                   the modulation period). The model's output consists
                   of the difference between the subunit outputs.
                   Direction of movement is indicated by the sign of the
                   model output. Mathematical analysis of the model
                   yielded several predictions that were confirmed
                   experimentally. Specifically, we found that (1)
                   performance with complex patterns can be predicted by
                   spatiotemporal Fourier analysis that results in the
                   segregation and linear addition in the output for
                   different temporal frequencies; (2) under special
                   conditions, performance depends on the product of
                   adjacent bar amplitudes, offering strong support for
                   the multiplication principle; (3) performance is
                   unaffected by addition of stationary patterns; and
                   (4) addition of homogeneous flicker normally produces
                   no effect but under special conditions reverses
                   perceived direction. These and other results confirm
                   our model and reject several other models, including
                   Reichardt 's original model.},

  abstract =      {A motion sequence may be represented as a single
                   pattern in x-y-t space; a velocity of motion
                   corresponds to a three-dimensional orientation in
                   this space. Motion sinformation can be extracted by a
                   system that responds to the oriented spatiotemporal
                   energy. We discuss a class of models for human motion
                   mechanisms in which the first stage consists of
                   linear filters that are oriented in space-time and
                   tuned in spatial frequency. The outputs of quadrature
                   pairs of such filters are squared and summed to give
                   a measure of motion energy. These responses are then
                   fed into an opponent stage. Energy models can be
                   built from elements that are consistent with known
                   physiology and psychophysics, and they permit a
                   qualitative understanding of a variety of motion
                   phenomena.},
